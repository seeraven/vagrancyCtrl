usage: vagrancyCtrl delete [-h] [-f] [-p PROVIDER] box_name [version]

Delete matching vagrant boxes from the vagrancy server. The box to delete
must be specified as an argument, e.g., as:
 vagrancyCtrl delete base/ubuntu-14.04.5-server-armv7-daily_pkgbuildbox

To delete only a certain version of the box, you can specify a pattern as
the second argument. This pattern is matched with all found versions of the
box and only matching versions are deleted. The special version '-1' can be
used to match all but the latest version:
 vagrancyCtrl delete base/ubuntu-14.04.5-server-armv7-daily_pkgbuildbox -1

Like the print command, you can specifiy a provider using the '--provider'
option to limit the deletion to the specified provider.

Please note that the deletion is only performed when you specify the '--force'
option. Otherwise, only the matching URLs are printed. This is a precaution to
avoid unintentional deletion.

Return codes:
 0 - Communication was successfull.
 1 - Communication failed.

positional arguments:
  box_name              The vagrant box name pattern. A box name must have a layout of <username>/<boxname>. Default: *
  version               The version to delete. The string is interpreted as a shell pattern. Use '*' to delete all versions or '-1' to delete all but the latest version. Default: *

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
