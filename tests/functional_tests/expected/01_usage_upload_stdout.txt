usage: vagrancyCtrl upload [-h] [-d] input_file box_name provider [version]

Upload a vagrant box to the vagrancy server. You have to specify the file, the
name of the vagrant box, the provider and the version of the box. If you want
to automatically generate a new version based on the latest version, you can
use '-1' as the version specifier.

In addition, you can automatically delete all other versions of the vagrant box
on the vagrancy server. This is especially useful in combination with the
automatic version number generation to upload a new 'latest' version.

Return codes:
 0 - Communication was successfull.
 1 - Communication failed.
